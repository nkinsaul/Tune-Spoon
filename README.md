## Learning Goals
- Build our own backend [Hosted here](https://tune-spoon-db-v1.herokuapp.com/) with [docs here](https://github.com/nkinsaul/Tune-Spoon-api)
- Use that backend to build a React app that Gets and Posts data to our hosted database
- Integrate react router for a seemless single page application experience that mimics a multipage site
- Develop robust end-to-end testing through Cypress

## Description
Tune Spoon is a fun single-page application that allows users to view a currated list of albums and select albums they have listened to in order to display additional album details, add the chosen album to their favorites, or to a leave a review comment on the album page. This project was accomplished by a team of 4 turing students in our 3rd mod and this was our first time building a full stack application from scratch.
